<p>Hey there! My name is Yazied.</p><!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->
<p>
My full name is Yazied Dhiya Uddien Abdurrahman, I started my career 
in the world of Software Engineering in 2015, approximately 9 years ago as an Android Developer 
when I first left formal vocational school, after 1 year of work I continued my formal college education 
in In 2016 - 2020, during college I was still working/freelancing as a Full Stack Engineer in various 
companies, I was an Expert Staff Software Engineer in a government agency, after graduating from 
college in November 2020 I entered a Startup as an Android Developer and created applications from 
zero to 10,000 Download with Crash-Free above 95%, then in 2021 I joined LinkAja as a Senior Android Developer

<p>
Then in 2022 there was an opportunity to become a Senior Backend Engineer and because I have the 
ability not only on 1 platform, I converted from Senior Android Engineer to Senior Backend Engineer 
at LinkAja, during my time as a Senior Backend Engineer.
